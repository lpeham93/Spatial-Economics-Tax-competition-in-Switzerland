The distance data we use to define the weights matrix is confidential and was provided by Raphael Parchet. If you want to use this data, please contact Mr Parchet. The main data set is available at https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150206

Our main contribution is that the use of spatial panel regression methods support the previous findings of Raphael Parchet.
